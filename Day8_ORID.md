ORID Practice:

Objective (O) [What did we learn today? What activities did you do? what scenes have impressed you?]

We learn about the JAVA Spring Boot framework with Mapper and Flyway today. And we also kick start the react part talking about
state usage.

Relection: Challenging

Interpretive: 
感觉因为项目组做API为主,没有需要做前端设计, 而且我本身也没有学习react的经验,总体上也是比较吃力的.
但是我认为这也是一个很好的机会让我可以学习前端设计, 因为项目组上我总有机会学习后端的内容.
相对其他学生可能已在项目有前端的经验,作为晚加入公司的, 我认为我应该花更多时间好好学习, 仲不能够让其他学生配合我的进度.

Decisional: 
Spend more time in learning react and catch up with the learning progress. Try to search more online about react and 
communicate with Don and Zane more on the React as a team.
